# Repository Migration

Tools & ideas for migrating data from a MODS-based EQUELLA repository to Datacite InvenioRDM.

Semantics: EQUELLA objects are _items_ with _attachments_. Invenio objects are _records_ with _files_. EQUELLA has _taxonomies_; Invenio has _vocabularies_. We use these terms consistently so it's clear what format an object is in (e.g. `python migrate/record.py item.json > record.json` converts an _item_ into a _record_).

## Setup & Tests

```sh
uv install # get dependencies, takes awhile due to spacy's en_core_web_lg model
uv run pytest -v migrate/tests.py # run tests
```

## Vocabularies

Invenio uses [vocabularies](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/customize/vocabularies/) to represent a number of fixtures beyond just subject headings, like names, description types, and creator roles. They're stored under the app_data directory and loaded when an instance is initialized. Many of our controlled lists in contribution wizards and EQUELLA taxonomies will be mapped to vocabularies.

The **taxos** dir contains exported EQUELLA taxonomies and tools for working with them. The **vocab** dir contains YAML files for Invenio vocabularies.

Notable scripts that create Invenio vocabularies:

- [taxos/users.py](./taxos/users.py) creates the [names.yaml](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/operate/customize/vocabularies/names/) and [users.yaml](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/operate/customize/users/#add-users-via-fixtures) fixtures
- [taxos/roles.py](./taxos/roles.py) creates the Invenio relator `creatorsroles` and `contributorsroles` in a file named roles.yaml

### Subjects

We create two subject vocabularies: "lc" for terms with URIs in an external authority and "cca_local" with UUIDs for local terms not present in any authority. **NOTE**: we are probably restructuring this. We are considering multiple subjects organized by theme (name, subject, genre/form, etc.) and using Getty/Wikidata instead of LC.

Download the [subjects sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1la_wsFPOkHLjpv4-f3tWwMsCd0_xzuqZ5xp_p1zAAoA/edit#gid=1465207925) and run `python migrate/mk_subjects.py data/subjects.csv` to create the YAML vocabularies in the vocab dir (lc.yaml and cca_local.yaml) as well as migrate/subjects_map.json which is used by `Record`'s [`find_subjects`](./migrate/subjects.py) to convert the text of VAULT subject terms into Invenio identifiers or keyword subjects without an id.

If an `INVENIO_REPO` env var is set, vocabs are copied to the Invenio instance. We should be able to update existing vocabs with `invenio rdm add-to-fixture`. If not, the site can rebuilt like `invenio-cli services destroy` and then `invenio-cli services setup`.

## Creating Records in Invenio

We need to load the necessary fixtures before creating records. Anywhere an identifier is used, whether in a subject, resource type, or relation, it must exist in Invenio. If we attempt to load a record with an `id` that doesn't exist yet, we get a 500 error.

- **migrate/record.py**: converts EQUELLA item(s) into Invenio record JSON
- **migrate/api.py**: converts an item and `POST`s it to Invenio to create a metadata-only record
- **migrate/import.py**: imports an item _directory_ (created by [the export tool](https://github.com/cca/equella_scripts/tree/main/collection-export)) with its attachments to Invenio

The scripts rely on a personal access token for an administrator account in Invenio:

1. Sign in as an admin
2. Go to **Applications** > **Personal access tokens**
3. Create oneâ€”its name and the `user:email` scope (as of v12) do not matter
4. Copy it to clipboard and **Save**
5. Paste in .env and/or set it as an env var, e.g. `set -x INVENIO_TOKEN=xyz` in fish

Below, we migrate a VAULT item to an Invenio record and post it to Invenio.

```sh
# fish shell
set -x INVENIO_TOKEN abc123; set -x HOST 127.0.0.1:5000 # better: edit into .env
python migrate/api.py items/item.json
HTTP 201 https://127.0.0.1:5000/api/records/k7qk8-fqq15/draft
HTTP 202 https://127.0.0.1:5000/records/k7qk8-fqq15
...
```

You can sometimes trip over yourself if the `.env` file in the project root is loaded and contains an outdated personal access token. If API calls fail with 403 errors, check that the `TOKEN` or `INVENIO_TOKEN` variable is set correctly.

Rerunning a "migrate" script with the same input creates a new record, it doesn't update the existing one.

## Items

We can download metadata for all items using equella-cli and a script like this:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env fish
set total (eq search -l 1 | jq '.available')
set length 50 # can only download up to 50 at a time
set pages (math floor $total / $length)
for i in (seq 0 $pages)
  set start (math $i x $length)
  echo "Downloading items $start to" (math $start + $length)
  # NOTE: no attachment info, use "--info all" for both attachments & metadata
  eq search -l $length --info metadata --start $start > json/$i.json
end
```

## Metadata Crosswalk

We can use the `item.metadata` XML of existing VAULT items for testing. Generally, `python migrate/record.py items/item.json | jq` to see the JSON Invenio record. See [our crosswalk diagrams](https://cca.github.io/vault_migration/crosswalk.html).

Schemas:

- https://cca.github.io/vault_schema/
- https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/metadata/

It's likely our schema is outdated/inaccurate in places.

How to map a field:

- Add a brief description to the mermaid diagram in [docs/crosswalk.html](docs/crosswalk.html)
- Write a test in tests.py with your input XML and expected record output
- Write a `Record` method in migrate.py & use it in the `Record::get()` dict
- Run tests, optionally run a record migration as described above
